# Maze_Runner
How to use:
1. Open Main script, feed the path(directory) of any maze that you want to solve.
2. Uncomment either b.bfs() or a_star.a_s_() for bfs solution or a* solution respectively.
3. Hit build.
4. Set start point and end point with your mouse.
5. Note a* won't give shortest path in all cases due to the heuristic used. I've used the Manhattan distance heuristic.
6. bfs is guaranteed to give shortest path.
7. shortest path is shown in black.
